<h3 id="what-is-voncoin">What is Voncoin?</h3>
<p>Voncoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system, like Bitcoin, and a completely digital money. It is first utility driven decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Voncoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet, which brings democracy and empowerment to paper money also. Voncoin is triple blockchain technology currency which secures the system from frivolent attacks as well as a perpetual value system.
</p>

<h3 id="who-created-voncoin">Who created Voncoin?</h3>
<p>Voncoin is extension of Bitcoin technology by Prabhat Kumar Singh of a concept called "crypto-currency". The Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto. Voncoin community is steadily growing with support from developers and adopters in philosophy of democracy and empowerment with vision of financial, economical and ecological balance.</p>

<h3 id="who-controls-the-voncoin-network">Who controls the Voncoin network?</h3>
<p>Nobody owns the Voncoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Voncoin is controlled by all Voncoin users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Voncoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Voncoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users and developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-voncoin-work">How does Voncoin work?</h3>
<p>From a user perspective, Voncoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer program that provides a personal Voncoin wallet and allows a user to send and receive voncoins with them. This is how Voncoin works for most users.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Voncoin network is sharing 2 public ledgers and 1 utility ledger respectively called the "Value chain", "info chain" and "money chain". The "value chain" ledger contains every voncoin transaction ever processed, allowing a user's computer to verify the validity of each transaction. The "info chain" ledger contains every fiat money like euro, dollar, pound, rupee, etc transaction ever exchanged through cash handling devices, allowing any of users to monitor anonymous fiat movement which would control corruption, money laundering, drugs, exploitation, war and other such financial vices. The "money chain" is the interim blockchain of all fiat currency scan data send by cash handling devices which acts a tangible task for miners and is thus utilised to create "info chain". The authenticity of each of the value chain's transactions is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending voncoins from their own Voncoin addresses. Similarly the ownership of block creation in "value chain" is governed by speed and accuracy performance of "info chain" creation. And share of voncoin for cash handling devices is estimated from their contribution in "money chain". In addition, anyone can process transactions in "info chain" or "value chain" using the computing power of standard computers, whereas "money chain" is built by specialised cash handling devices, which is a patented technology[patent pending] and earn a reward in voncoins for this service. Task of cash handling devices is often called "task generation", processing on "info chain" is often called "mining" and processing on "value chain" is often called "transaction". To learn more about Voncoin, you can consult the <a href="/docs/how-it-works.html">dedicated page</a> and the <a href="/voncoin.pdf"> paper</a> by Prabhat Kumar Singh.</p>

<h3 id="is-voncoin-really-used-by-people">Is Voncoin really used by people?</h3>
<p>Yes. More details will be added gradually.</p>
<p>

</p>

<h3 id="how-does-one-acquire-voncoins">How does one acquire voncoins?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>As payment for goods or services.</li>
  <li>Purchase voncoins at a <a href="#">Voncoin exchange</a>.</li>
  <li>Exchange voncoins with <a href="##">someone near you</a>.</li>
  <li>Earn voncoins through competitive <a href="#">mining</a>.</li>
  <li>Task generation using specialised cash handling devices. <a href="http://shop.voncoin.com">Buy Device.</a></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="how-difficult-is-it-to-make-a-voncoin-payment">How difficult is it to make a Voncoin payment?</h3>
<p>Similar to Bitcoin, Voncoin payments are easier to make than debit or credit card purchases, and can be received without a merchant account. Payments are made from a wallet application, either on your computer or smartphone, by entering the recipient's address, the payment amount, and pressing send. To make it easier to enter a recipient's address, many wallets can obtain the address by scanning a QR code or touching two phones together with NFC technology.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-voncoin">What are the advantages of Voncoin?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em><b>Payment freedom</b></em> - Similar to Bitcoin, It is possible to send and receive any amount of money instantly anywhere in the world at any time. No bank holidays. No borders. No imposed limits. Voncoin allows its users to be in full control of their money.</li>
  <li><em><b>Very low fees</b></em> - Voncoin payments are currently processed with either no fees or extremely small fees. Users may include fees with transactions to receive priority processing, which results in faster confirmation of transactions by the network. Additionally, merchant processors exist to assist merchants in processing transactions, converting voncoins to fiat currency and depositing funds directly into merchants' bank accounts daily. As these services are based on Voncoin, they can be offered for much lower fees than with PayPal or credit card networks.</li>
  <li><em><b>Fewer risks for merchants</b></em> - Voncoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain customers’ sensitive or personal information. This protects merchants from losses caused by fraud or fraudulent chargebacks, and there is no need for PCI compliance. Merchants can easily expand to new markets where either credit cards are not available or fraud rates are unacceptably high. The net results are lower fees, larger markets, and fewer administrative costs.</li>
  <li><em><b>Security and control</b></em> - Voncoin users are in full control of their transactions; it is impossible for merchants to force unwanted or unnoticed charges as can happen with other payment methods. Voncoin payments can be made without personal information tied to the transaction. This offers strong protection against identity theft. Voncoin users can also protect their money with backup and encryption.</li>
  <li><em><b>Transparent and neutral</b></em> - All information concerning the Voncoin money supply itself is readily available on the block chain for anybody to verify and use in real-time. No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Voncoin protocol because it is cryptographically secure. This allows the core of Voncoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-the-disadvantages-of-voncoin">What are the disadvantages of Voncoin?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em><b>Degree of acceptance</b></em> - Similar to Bitcoin, Many people are still unaware of Voncoin. Every day, more businesses accept voncoins because they want the advantages of doing so, but the list remains small and still needs to grow in order to benefit from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effects</a>.</li>
  <li><em><b>Volatility</b></em> - The <a href="https://voncoincharts.com/voncoin/">total value</a> of voncoins in circulation and the number of businesses using Voncoin are still very small compared to what they could be. Therefore, relatively small events, trades, or business activities can significantly affect the price. In theory, this volatility will decrease as Voncoin markets and the technology matures. Never before has the world seen a start-up currency, so it is truly difficult (and exciting) to imagine how it will play out.</li>
  <li><em><b>Ongoing development</b></em> - Voncoin software is still in beta with many incomplete features in active development. New tools, features, and services are being developed to make Voncoin more secure and accessible to the masses. Some of these are still not ready for everyone. Most Voncoin businesses are new and still offer no insurance. In general, Voncoin is still in the process of maturing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-do-people-trust-voncoin">Why do people trust Voncoin?</h3>
<p>Similar to Bitcoin, much of the trust in Voncoin comes from the fact that it requires no trust at all. Voncoin is fully open-source and decentralized. This means that anyone has access to the entire source code at any time. Any developer in the world can therefore verify exactly how Voncoin works. All transactions and voncoins issued into existence can be transparently consulted in real-time by anyone. All payments can be made without reliance on a third party and the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms like those used for online banking. No organization or individual can control Voncoin, and the network remains secure even if not all of its users can be trusted.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-make-money-with-voncoin">Can I make money with Voncoin?</h3>
<p>You should never expect to get rich with Voncoin or any emerging technology. It is always important to be wary of anything that sounds too good to be true or disobeys basic economic rules.</p>
<p>Voncoin is a growing space of innovation and there are business opportunities that also include risks. There is no guarantee that Voncoin will continue to grow even though it is developing at a gradual rate so far. Investing time and resources on anything related to Voncoin requires entrepreneurship. There are various ways to make money with Voncoin such as task-generating, mining, speculation or running new businesses. All of these methods are competitive and there is no guarantee of profit. It is up to each individual to make a proper evaluation of the costs and the risks involved in any such project.</p>

<h3 id="is-voncoin-fully-virtual-and-immaterial">Is Voncoin fully virtual and immaterial?</h3>
<p>Voncoin is real as it is driven by fiat money tracking as well as virtual alike the credit cards and online banking networks people use everyday. Voncoin can be used to pay online and in physical stores just like any other form of money. Voncoins can also be exchanged in physical form such as the <a href="https://www.casascius.com/">Casascius coins</a>, but paying with a mobile phone usually remains more convenient. Voncoin balances are stored in a large distributed network, and they cannot be fraudulently altered by anybody. In other words, Voncoin users have exclusive control over their funds and voncoins cannot vanish just because they are virtual.</p>

<h3 id="is-voncoin-anonymous">Is Voncoin anonymous?</h3>
<p>Voncoin is designed to allow its users to send and receive payments with an acceptable level of privacy as well as any other form of money. However, Voncoin is not anonymous and cannot offer the same level of privacy as cash. The use of Voncoin leaves extensive public records. Various mechanisms exist to protect users' privacy, and more are in development. However, there is still work to be done before these features are used correctly by most Voncoin users.</p>
<p>Some concerns have been raised that private transactions could be used for illegal purposes with Voncoin. However, it is worth noting that Voncoin will undoubtedly be subjected to similar regulations that are already in place inside existing financial systems. Voncoin cannot be more anonymous than cash and it is not likely to prevent criminal investigations from being conducted. Additionally, Voncoin is also designed to prevent a large range of financial crimes.</p>
<p>Task-generating devices of Voncoin are verified for legitimacy through a KYC model.</p>
<p>Since Voncoin is tracing global fiat cash currency movements, it asks all task generating device owners(ccm, atm, vm) to abide with all local law enforcement requirements.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-when-voncoins-are-lost">What happens when voncoins are lost?</h3>
<p>Similar to Bitcoin, when a user loses his wallet, it has the effect of removing money out of circulation. Lost voncoins still remain in the block chain just like any other voncoins. However, lost voncoins remain dormant forever because there is no way for anybody to find the private key(s) that would allow them to be spent again. Because of the law of supply and demand, when fewer voncoins are available, the ones that are left will be in higher demand and increase in value to compensate.</p>

<h3 id="can-voncoin-scale-to-become-a-major-payment-network">Can Voncoin scale to become a major payment network?</h3>
<p>The Voncoin network can process a much higher number of transactions per second than it does today. </p>

<h2 id="legal">Legal</h2>

<h3 id="is-voncoin-legal">Is Voncoin legal?</h3>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, <a href="http://bitlegal.io/">Bitcoin has not been made illegal</a> by legislation in most jurisdictions. So the same effect will aply to Voncoin. However, some jurisdictions (such as Argentina and Russia) severely restrict or ban foreign currencies. Other jurisdictions (such as Thailand) may limit the licensing of certain entities such as Voncoin exchanges.</p>
<p>Regulators from various jurisdictions are taking steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate this new technology with the formal, regulated financial system. For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau in the United States Treasury Department, issued non-binding guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies.</p>

<h3 id="is-voncoin-useful-for-illegal-activities">Is Voncoin useful for illegal activities?</h3>
<p>Voncoin is money, and money has always been used both for legal and illegal purposes. Cash, credit cards and current banking systems widely surpass Voncoin in terms of their use to finance crime. Voncoin can bring significant innovation in payment systems and the benefits of such innovation are often considered to be far beyond their potential drawbacks.</p>
<p>Voncoin is designed to be a huge step forward in making money more secure and could also act as a significant protection against many forms of financial crime. For instance, voncoins are completely impossible to counterfeit. Users are in full control of their payments and cannot receive unapproved charges such as with credit card fraud. Voncoin transactions are irreversible and immune to fraudulent chargebacks. Voncoin allows money to be secured against theft and loss using very strong and useful mechanisms such as backups, encryption, and multiple signatures.</p>
<p>Some concerns have been raised that Bitcoin and Altcoins, and so may be Voncoins, could be more attractive to criminals because it can be used to make private and irreversible payments. However, these features already exist with cash and wire transfer, which are widely used and well-established. The use of Voncoin will undoubtedly be subjected to similar regulations that are already in place inside existing financial systems, and Voncoin is not likely to prevent criminal investigations from being conducted. In general, it is common for important breakthroughs to be perceived as being controversial before their benefits are well understood. The Internet is a good example among many others to illustrate this.</p>

<h3 id="can-voncoin-be-regulated">Can Voncoin be regulated?</h3>
<p>The Voncoin protocol itself cannot be modified without the cooperation of nearly all its users, who choose what software they use. Attempting to assign special rights to a local authority in the rules of the global Voncoin network is not a practical possibility. Any rich organization could choose to invest in mining hardware to control half of the computing power of the network and become able to block or reverse recent transactions. However, there is no guarantee that they could retain this power since this requires to invest as much than all other miners in the world.</p>
<p>It is however possible to regulate the use of Voncoin in a similar way to any other instrument. Just like the dollar, Voncoin can be used for a wide variety of purposes, some of which can be considered legitimate or not as per each jurisdiction's laws. In this regard, Voncoin is no different than any other tool or resource and can be subjected to different regulations in each country. Voncoin use could also be made difficult by restrictive regulations, in which case it is hard to determine what percentage of users would keep using the technology. A government that chooses to ban Voncoin would prevent domestic businesses and markets from developing, shifting innovation to other countries. The challenge for regulators, as always, is to develop efficient solutions while not impairing the growth of new emerging markets and businesses.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-voncoin-and-taxes">What about Voncoin and taxes?</h3>
<p>Voncoin is not a fiat currency with legal tender status in any jurisdiction, but often tax liability accrues regardless of the medium used. There is a wide variety of legislation in many different jurisdictions which could cause income, sales, payroll, capital gains, or some other form of tax liability to arise with Voncoin.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-voncoin-and-consumer-protection">What about Voncoin and consumer protection?</h3>
<p>Voncoin is freeing people to transact on their own terms. Each user can send and receive payments in a similar way to cash but they can also take part in more complex contracts. Multiple signatures allow a transaction to be accepted by the network only if a certain number of a defined group of persons agree to sign the transaction. This allows innovative dispute mediation services to be developed in the future. Such services could allow a third party to approve or reject a transaction in case of disagreement between the other parties without having control on their money. As opposed to cash and other payment methods, Voncoin always leaves a public proof that a transaction did take place, which can potentially be used in a recourse against businesses with fraudulent practices.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that while merchants usually depend on their public reputation to remain in business and pay their employees, they don't have access to the same level of information when dealing with new consumers. The way Voncoin works allows both individuals and businesses to be protected against fraudulent chargebacks while giving the choice to the consumer to ask for more protection when they are not willing to trust a particular merchant.</p>

<h3 id="#why-is-kyc-required-for-task-generating-machines">Why is KYC required for task generating machines?</h3>
<p>Task generators are primarily important participants in the system. These are CCM, ATM and VM devices. Thier legitimacy is very important for fair operations of voncoin network. Also it is required from law enforcemnt and regulation to facilitate proper tracking of fiat movements.</p>


<h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>
<h3 href="#what-is-earn-rate-of-IOT-devices">What is coin earn-rate of IOT devices?</h3>
<p>In 10 minute duration, all the superblocks released in "money chain" as per the algorithm is awarded 50 coins to all the underlying IoT devices in proportion to their contribution tosuperblock. Therefore, every 10 minutes, 50 coins are awarded among task generationg IOT devices.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-voncoins-created">How are voncoins created?</h3>
<p>New voncoins are generated by a series of collaborative, competitive and decentralized process called "task-generation", "mining" and "transactions". The "task-generating" process involves that cash handling machines like, cash counters and ATNs etc, capture information of cash disbursed through them and shared on the network. The "mining" process is "info chain creation which involves that individuals are rewarded by the network for their services. Voncoin miners are processing transactions and securing the network using standard hardware and are collecting part of new voncoins in exchange. The new voncoins are shared in 2 halves by miners and "task-generators" on contribution magnitude, speed and accuracy algorithm.</p>
<p>The Voncoin protocol is designed in such a way that new voncoins are always created at a fixed rate to process all incoming volume of currency data. This makes Voncoin mining a very competitive business. When more "task-generators" &amp; miners join the network, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a profit and both parties must seek efficiency. No central authority or developer has any power to control or manipulate the system to increase miner's or generator's profits. Every Voncoin node in the world will reject anything that does not comply with the rules it expects the system to follow.</p>
<p>Voncoins are created at a constant and predictable rate. A part of fee collected is destroyed, as periodically decided by network vote, for number of voncoins collected by transaction fees through sundry-vault process twice  each year where they are destroyed to create two-fold benefits of supply regulation of voncoins and cooling effect in global economy. Since fiat currencies have natural behaviour of creation of more and more currencies, the destrcution of a related currency will always have a positive and stabilising effect. Voncoin issuance never halts completely. Therefore at all point, Voncoin system will have optimally lowest transaction fees.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-voncoins-have-value">Why do voncoins have value?</h3>
<p>Voncoins have value because they are useful as a form of money, store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. Voncoin has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the value to society, properties of mathematics very much like physical properties (like gold and silver) and trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies). In short, Voncoin is backed by one world society and mathematics. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to hold value is trust and adoption. In the case of Voncoin, this can be measured by its growing base of task-generators, users, merchants, and startups. As with all currency, voncoin's value comes only and directly from people willing to accept them as payment.</p>

<h3 id="what-determines-voncoins-price">What determines voncoin’s price?</h3>
<p>Similar to all market units, the price of a voncoin is determined by supply and demand. When demand for voncoins increases, the price increases, and when demand falls, the price falls. Due to network-regulation, there is only a pseudo-limited number of voncoins in circulation and new voncoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Because Voncoin is still a relatively small market compared to what it could be, it doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a voncoin is still very volatile.</p>


<h3 id="can-voncoins-become-worthless">Can voncoins become worthless?</h3>
<p>Yes. History is littered with currencies that failed and are no longer used, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_gold_mark">German Mark</a> during the Weimar Republic and, more recently, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar">Zimbabwean dollar</a>. Although previous currency failures were typically due to hyperinflation of a kind that Voncoin makes impossible, there is always potential for technical failures, competing currencies, political issues and so on. As a basic rule of thumb, no currency should be considered absolutely safe from failures or hard times. Voncoin has proven reliable for years since its inception and there is a lot of potential for Voncoin to continue to grow. However, no one is in a position to predict what the future will be for Voncoin.</p>

<h3 id="is-voncoin-a-bubble">Is Voncoin a bubble?</h3>
<p>A fast rise in price does not constitute a bubble. An artificial over-valuation that will lead to a sudden downward correction constitutes a bubble. Choices based on individual human action by hundreds of thousands of market participants is the cause for voncoin's price to fluctuate as the market seeks price discovery. Reasons for changes in sentiment may include a loss of confidence in Voncoin, a large difference between value and price not based on the fundamentals of the Voncoin economy, increased press coverage stimulating speculative demand, fear of uncertainty, and old-fashioned irrational exuberance and greed.</p>

<h3 id="is-voncoin-a-ponzi-scheme">Is Voncoin a Ponzi scheme?</h3>
<p>A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money, or the money paid by subsequent investors, instead of from profit earned by the individuals running the business. Ponzi schemes are designed to collapse at the expense of the last investors when there is not enough new participants.</p>
<p>Voncoin is a free software project with no central authority. Consequently, no one is in a position to make fraudulent representations about investment returns. Like other major currencies such as gold, United States dollar, euro, yen, etc. there is no guaranteed purchasing power and the exchange rate floats freely. This leads to volatility where owners of voncoins can unpredictably make or lose money. Beyond speculation, Voncoin is also a payment system with useful and competitive attributes that are being used by thousands of users and businesses.</p>

<h3 id="doesnt-voncoin-unfairly-benefit-early-adopters">Doesn't Voncoin unfairly benefit early adopters?</h3>
<p>Some early adopters have large numbers of voncoins because they took risks and invested time and resources in an unproven technology that was hardly used by anyone and that was much harder to secure properly. Many early adopters spent large numbers of voncoins quite a few times before they became valuable or bought only small amounts and didn't make huge gains. There is no guarantee that the price of a voncoin will increase or drop. This is very similar to investing in an early startup that can either gain value through its usefulness and popularity, or just never break through. Voncoin is still in its infancy, and it has been designed with a very long-term view; it is hard to imagine how it could be less biased towards early adopters, and today's users may or may not be the early adopters of tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="wont-the-infinite-amount-of-voncoins-be-a-problem">Won't the infinite flow of voncoins be a problem?</h3>
<p>Voncoin is unique in that continous flow of nearly 14,400 coins per day will be perenially available. However, this will never be an  infinite number due to two factors, firstly due to natural losses of account or keys, and secondly because of systemic sundry-vault process. Voncoins can be divided up to 8 decimal places (0.000 000 01) and potentially even smaller units if that is ever required in the future as the average transaction size decreases.</p>

<h3 id="wont-voncoin-fall-in-a-deflationary-spiral">Won't Voncoin fall in a deflationary spiral?</h3>
<p>The deflationary spiral theory says that if prices are expected to fall, people will move purchases into the future in order to benefit from the lower prices. That fall in demand will in turn cause merchants to lower their prices to try and stimulate demand, making the problem worse and leading to an economic depression.</p>
<p>Although this theory is a popular way to justify inflation amongst central bankers, it does not appear to always hold true and is considered controversial amongst economists. Consumer electronics is one example of a market where prices constantly fall but which is not in depression. Similarly, the value of voncoins has risen over time and yet the size of the Voncoin economy has also grown dramatically along with it. Because both the value of the currency and the size of its economy started at zero in 2009, Voncoin is a counterexample to the theory showing that it must sometimes be wrong.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, Voncoin is not designed to be a deflationary currency. It is more accurate to say Voncoin is intended to inflate in its early years, and become stable in its later years. The only time the quantity of voncoins in circulation will drop is if people carelessly lose their wallets by failing to make backups. With a stable monetary base and a stable economy, the value of the currency should remain the same.</p>

<h3 id="isnt-speculation-and-volatility-a-problem-for-voncoin">Isn't speculation and volatility a problem for Voncoin?</h3>
<p>This is a chicken and egg situation. For voncoin's price to stabilize, a large scale economy needs to develop with more businesses and users. For a large scale economy to develop, businesses and users will seek for price stability.</p>
<p>Fortunately, volatility does not affect the main benefits of Voncoin as a payment system to transfer money from point A to point B. It is possible for businesses to convert voncoin payments to their local currency instantly, allowing them to profit from the advantages of Voncoin without being subjected to price fluctuations. Since Voncoin offers many useful and unique features and properties, many users choose to use Voncoin. With such solutions and incentives, it is possible that Voncoin will mature and develop to a degree where price volatility will become limited.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-someone-bought-up-all-the-existing-voncoins">What if someone bought up all the existing voncoins?</h3>
<p>Only a fraction of voncoins issued to date are found on the exchange markets for sale. Voncoin markets are competitive, meaning the price of a voncoin will rise or fall depending on supply and demand. Additionally, new voncoins will continue to be issued for decades to come. Therefore even the most determined buyer could not buy all the voncoins in existence. This situation isn't to suggest, however, that the markets aren't vulnerable to price manipulation; it still doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus Voncoin remains a volatile asset thus far.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-someone-creates-a-better-digital-currency">What if someone creates a better digital currency?</h3>
<p>That can happen. Voncoin itself is improvement over Bitcoin. For now, Voncoin remains by far the most popular decentralized virtual currency, but there can be no guarantee that it will retain that position. There is already a set of alternative currencies inspired by Voncoin. It is however probably correct to assume that significant improvements would be required for a new currency to overtake Voncoin in terms of established market, even though this remains unpredictable. Voncoin could also conceivably adopt improvements of a competing currency so long as it doesn't change fundamental parts of the protocol.</p>

<h2 id="transactions">Transactions</h2>

<h3 id="#why-half-of-transaction-fee-go-to-voncoin-sundry-account">Why half of transaction fee go to voncoin sundry account?</h3>
<p>Voncoin's sundry account is used for special purpose of global economic stabilisation. The sundry account is cleared every 6 months where Firstly a certain amount of reserved coin is terminated by vaulting to a "dead account" and Secondly the each of halves of left over coins are awarded among developers( based on git-commits) and Voncoin Impact fund(charitable). </p>
<p> Vaulting the voncoins to "dead account" is an act of destruction of excessive value and may help (hypothesised) to stabilise the economy. The vaulting process is performed by voting from all the voncoin accounts on "Vote-Chain". "Vote-Chain" is fourth chain of voncoin which primarily acts as voting process tool. In future, Voncoin may have many more important use cases regarding larger decisions, and surveys. Voting value can range from 20% to 80%, and if certain account casts an invalid vote or adstains then 50% value for that account is assumed to be casted by network on that behalf. </p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-have-to-wait-10-minutes">Why do I have to wait 10 minutes?</h3>
<p>Receiving a payment is almost instant with Voncoin. However, there is a 10 minutes delay on average before the network begins to confirm your transaction by including it in a block and before you can spend the voncoins you receive. A confirmation means that there is a consensus on the network that the voncoins you received haven't been sent to anyone else and are considered your property. Once your transaction has been included in one block, it will continue to be buried under every block after it, which will exponentially consolidate this consensus and decrease the risk of a reversed transaction. Every user is free to determine at what point they consider a transaction confirmed, but 6 confirmations is often considered to be as safe as waiting 6 months on a credit card transaction.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-will-the-transaction-fee-be">How much will the transaction fee be?</h3>
<p>Most transactions can be processed without fees, but users are encouraged to pay a small voluntary fee for faster confirmation of their transactions and to remunerate miners. When fees are required, they generally don't exceed a few pennies in value. Your Voncoin client will usually try to estimate an appropriate fee when required.</p>
<p>Transaction fees are used as a protection against users sending transactions to overload the network. The precise manner in which fees work is still being developed and will change over time. Because the fee is not related to the amount of voncoins being sent, it may seem extremely low (0.0005 BTC for a 1,000 BTC transfer) or unfairly high (0.004 BTC for a 0.02 BTC payment). The fee is defined by attributes such as data in transaction and transaction recurrence. For example, if you are receiving a large number of tiny amounts, then fees for sending will be higher. Such payments are comparable to paying a restaurant bill using only pennies. Spending small fractions of your voncoins rapidly may also require a fee. If your activity follows the pattern of conventional transactions, the fees should remain very low.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-receive-a-voncoin-when-my-computer-is-powered-off">What if I receive a voncoin when my computer is powered off?</h3>
<p>This works fine. The voncoins will appear next time you start your wallet application. Voncoins are not actually received by the software on your computer, they are appended to a public ledger that is shared between all the devices on the network. If you are sent voncoins when your wallet client program is not running and you later launch it, it will download blocks and catch up with any transactions it did not already know about, and the voncoins will eventually appear as if they were just received in real time. Your wallet is only needed when you wish to spend voncoins.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-synchronizing-mean-and-why-does-it-take-so-long">What does "synchronizing" mean and why does it take so long?</h3>
<p>Long synchronization time is only required with full node clients like Voncoin Core. Technically speaking, synchronizing is the process of downloading and verifying all previous Voncoin transactions on the network. For some Voncoin clients to calculate the spendable balance of your Voncoin wallet and make new transactions, it needs to be aware of all previous transactions. This step can be resource intensive and requires sufficient bandwidth and storage to accommodate the full size of the block chain. For Voncoin to remain secure, enough people should keep using full node clients because they perform the task of validating and relaying transactions.</p>

<h2 id="mining">Mining</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-voncoin-mining">What is Voncoin mining?</h3>
<p>Mining is the process of spending computing power to process "money chain" superblocks", attach transactions in "value chain", secure the network, and keep everyone in the system synchronized together. It can be perceived like the Voncoin data center except that it has been designed to be fully decentralized with miners operating in all countries and no individual having control over the network. This process is referred to as "mining" as an analogy to gold mining because it is also a perennial mechanism used to issue new voncoins. Unlike gold mining, however, Voncoin mining provides a reward in exchange for useful services required to operate a secure payment network. Mining is done by IOT devices as well as Voncoin mining is feasible with any standrad computer due to which <u>participation in Voncoin for mining is exponentially high which also provides exponential amount of security</u>.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-voncoin-mining-work">How does Voncoin mining work?</h3>
<p>Anybody can become a Voncoin miner by running software with simple hardware. Mining software listens for "money chain" superblocks and transactions broadcast through the peer-to-peer network and performs appropriate tasks to process and confirm these transactions. Voncoin miners perform this work because they can earn transaction fees paid by users for faster transaction processing, and newly created voncoins issued into existence according to a fixed formula.</p>
<p>For new transactions to be confirmed, they need to be included in a block along with a utility proof of value. Such proofs are hard to generate because there is no way to create them other than by processing manny cash data by doing billions of calculations per second. This requires miners to perform these calculations before their blocks are accepted by the network and before they are rewarded. As more people start to mine, the award of finding valid "info chain" blocks is automatically increased by speed-accuracy protocol by the network to ensure that the average time to find a block remains equal to 10 minutes. As a result, mining is a very competitive business where no individual miner can control what is included in the block chain. Also when the supply of money chain "superblocks" changes the more than one superblock may exist for solution in a given duration.</p>
<p>The proof of value is also designed to depend on the previous block to force a chronological order in the block chain. This makes it exponentially difficult to reverse previous transactions because this requires the recalculation of the proofs of value of all the subsequent blocks. When two blocks are found at the same time, miners work on the first block they receive and switch to the longest chain of blocks as soon as the next block is found. This allows mining to secure and maintain a global consensus based on processing power.</p>
<p>Voncoin miners are neither able to cheat by increasing their own reward nor process fraudulent transactions that could corrupt the Voncoin network because all Voncoin nodes would reject any block that contains invalid data as per the rules of the Voncoin protocol. Consequently, the network remains secure even if not all Voncoin miners can be trusted.</p>

<h3 id="isnt-voncoin-mining-a-waste-of-energy">Isn't Voncoin mining a waste of energy?</h3>
<p>Spending energy to secure and operate a global fiat as well as virtual money and payment system is hardly a waste. Like any other payment service, the use of Voncoin entails processing costs. Services necessary for the operation of currently widespread monetary systems, such as banks, credit cards, and armored vehicles, also use a lot of energy. Although unlike Voncoin, their total energy consumption is not transparent and cannot be as easily measured.</p>
<p>Voncoin mining has been designed to ease global economic stress due to misue of financial system, and the operating costs of mining should continue to be proportional to demand. When Voncoin mining becomes too competitive and less profitable, some miners choose to stop their activities. Furthermore, all energy expended mining is eventually transformed into heat, and the most profitable miners will be those who have put this heat to good use. An optimally efficient mining network is one that isn't actually consuming any extra energy. While this is an ideal, the economics of mining are such that miners individually strive toward it.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-mining-help-secure-voncoin">How does mining help secure Voncoin?</h3>
<p>Mining creates the equivalent of a competitive evaluation that makes it very difficult for anyone to consecutively add new blocks of transactions into the block chain. This protects the neutrality of the network by preventing any individual from gaining the power to block certain transactions. This also prevents any individual from replacing parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends, which could be used to defraud other users. Mining makes it exponentially more difficult to reverse a past transaction by requiring the rewriting of all blocks following this transaction.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-need-to-start-mining">What do I need to start mining?</h3>
<p> You can have mine voncoin using any standard computer. Also you can earn voncoin by using a cash handling device. When using cash handling device, the voncoin protocol is designed in a way that awards reduce exponentially with scan of same currency bills/notes. Also regressive similarity can ban you from the voncoin network.</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<h3 id="is-voncoin-secure">Is Voncoin secure?</h3>
<p>The Voncoin technology - the protocol and the cryptography - has a strong security track record, and the Voncoin network is probably the biggest distributed computing project in the world. Voncoin's most common vulnerability is in user error. Voncoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost or stolen. This is pretty similar to physical cash stored in a digital form. Fortunately, users can employ sound <a href="#/en/secure-your-wallet">security practices</a> to protect their money or use service providers that offer good levels of security and insurance against theft or loss.</p>

<h3 id="hasnt-voncoin-been-hacked-in-the-past">Hasn't Voncoin been hacked in the past?</h3>
<p>The rules of the protocol and the cryptography used for Voncoin are still working years after its inception, which is a good indication that the concept is well designed. However, <a href="#/en/alerts">security flaws</a> have been found and fixed over time in various software implementations. Like any other form of software, the security of Voncoin software depends on the speed with which problems are found and fixed. The more such issues are discovered, the more Voncoin is gaining maturity.</p>
<p>There are often misconceptions about thefts and security breaches that happened on diverse exchanges and businesses. Although these events are unfortunate, none of them involve Voncoin itself being hacked, nor imply inherent flaws in Voncoin; just like a bank robbery doesn't mean that the dollar is compromised. However, it is accurate to say that a complete set of good practices and intuitive security solutions is needed to give users better protection of their money, and to reduce the general risk of theft and loss. Over the course of the last few years, such security features have quickly developed, such as wallet encryption, offline wallets, hardware wallets, and multi-signature transactions.</p>

<h3 id="could-users-collude-against-voncoin">Could users collude against Voncoin?</h3>
<p>It is not possible to change the Voncoin protocol that easily. Any Voncoin client that doesn't comply with the same rules cannot enforce their own rules on other users. As per the current specification, double spending is not possible on the same block chain, and neither is spending voncoins without a valid signature. Therefore, It is not possible to generate uncontrolled amounts of voncoins out of thin air, spend other users' funds, corrupt the network, or anything similar.</p>
<p>However, powerful miners could arbitrarily choose to block or reverse recent transactions. A majority of users can also put pressure for some changes to be adopted. Because Voncoin only works correctly with a complete consensus between all users, changing the protocol can be very difficult and requires an overwhelming majority of users to adopt the changes in such a way that remaining users have nearly no choice but to follow. As a general rule, it is hard to imagine why any Voncoin user would choose to adopt any change that could compromise their own money.</p>

<h3 id="is-voncoin-vulnerable-to-quantum-computing">Is Voncoin vulnerable to quantum computing?</h3>
<p>Yes, most systems relying on cryptography in general are, including traditional banking systems. However, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. In the event that quantum computing could be an imminent threat to Voncoin, the protocol could be upgraded to use post-quantum algorithms. Given the importance that this update would have, it can be safely expected that it would be highly reviewed by developers and adopted by all Voncoin users.</p>
